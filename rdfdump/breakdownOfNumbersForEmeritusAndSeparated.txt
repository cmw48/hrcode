Emeritus
- not in vivoperson or vivojobs UNLESS they are emeritus and have an active appointment.
- exist as "lineitem" records in vivoemeritus
  * one line for each change
  * example Billie Jean Isbell: 
   1010593 BJI1    1       00136147        Prof Emeritus   Active  10/01/2011
   1010593 BJI1    0       00136147        Prof Emeritus   Retired 07/01/2002

  
  Get emeritus list of netId's and emplIds from d2r.
  look for netId in VIVO.
  
  
Separated
  - may have a current entry in vivoperson and vivojobs
  - sometimes "terminated" date is in the future (when your appointment ends?)
  - multiple line items for jobs (terminated and rehired?  job change?  multiple appointment renewals?)
  
  d2r groups by netId, bring forward date information
  (ignore future dates in D2R? of in Java code?)  
  get list of terminated netIds and emplIds from d2r
  check to see if those emplids exist in "active job list" from vivojobs
    - if yes, then employee is "Active", do nothing
	- if no, then employee is terminated/not active, and is a candidate for removal from VIVO
	  check vivo for netId/emplId
	  check for statements where person is subject/object of anohter triple
		- if named in authorship, grant, role, etc then tag as "terminated" and do not remove
		- if no connections to anything else (visiting scholar) then remove?

How many valid Cornell VIVO persons exist that are not being "touched" by HR?
	
	all foaf:Person = 61196
	  acti:Unk = 44855
	  vivoc:Unk = 44818
	  ~ 16,341 "known" persons
      ~  3,300 "non-CUvivo-persons" (no last name, mostly WeillPeople)
	    13,041 "good" CUvivo persons
		  - only 7,380 persons in "active" HR list, plus a possible 677 emeriti
		  - many of these ~8,000 "known HR persons" are not "vivoworthy"
		  
		  * Chris will query to determine if there are actually ~5,000 "known CU persons" that don't exist in the HR database...
